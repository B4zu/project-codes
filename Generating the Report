Generating the Report -Instructions

Add a line above the url declaration so it looks this way

report = ''
url = args.url

Change the forms part so it looks like this


for form in forms:

      if((form.get('action').find('https') < 0) and (urlparse(url).scheme != 'https')):
        report += 'Form Issue: Insecure form action ' + form.get('action') + ' found in document\n'

print(report)

Run the script test command and check the output
