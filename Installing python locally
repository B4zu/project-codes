Installing Python Locally

For this section, we will be developing with Python locally, so we will need to install it on a development environment. This just means that we will be running the code outside a REPL, but you can actually use a cloud IDE/online IDE if you don't want to use your local computer as a development environment.

Here is a list of documentation and options for installing Python

Mac OSX

https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/mac.html

Alternative, using Homebrew

https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python



Linux/Unix

https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/unix.html



Windows

https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/windows.html



Cloud

Codeanywhere: http://docs.codeanywhere.com/quicktutorial.html

Cloud9IDE: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/sample-python.html (AWS account required)
