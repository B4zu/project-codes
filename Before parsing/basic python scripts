Basic Python Script Instructions

Note: i am assuming you have installed Version 3.6+ of Python with the name of the executable being python3 and that you are running on a Unix/Linux compatible system.

Check for version of Python with

python3 -V

Create a new directory and enter it

mkdir achilles
cd achilles
Create a new file called achilles.py in this directory

Add this to it

#!/usr/bin/env python3
print('hello')
On the command line, run

chmod a+x achilles.py

Now run the tool, using

./achilles.py

It should print

hello
