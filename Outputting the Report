Outputting the Report -Instructions

Add the following to the argument parsing statements

parser.add_argument('-o', '--output', help='Report file output path')

Change the report generation portion to

if(report == ''):
  report += 'Nice job! Your HTML document is secure!\n'
else:
  header =  'Vulnerability Report is as follows:\n'
  header += '==================================\n\n'
 
  report = header + report
 
print(report)
 
if(args.output):
  f = open(args.output, 'w')
  f.write(report)
  f.close
  print('Report saved to: ' + args.output)
Try it out using

./achilles.py localhost:8000 -o report.txt

and then look through the report with

cat report.txt



Try it out with a different URL that should have no security issues for our tool to detect

./achilles.py YOUR_URL_HERE -o repor.txt
